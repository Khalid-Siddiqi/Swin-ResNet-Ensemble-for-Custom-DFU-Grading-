# Swin-ResNet-Ensemble-for-Custom-DFU-Grading/Classification-(1-4)
This repository presents an ensemble approach combining Swin Transformers and ResNet architectures to tackle a custom Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) grading/classification task across four severity levels (Grades 1-4).
The project explores the synergy between CNN-based and Transformer-based models to improve robustness and performance on medical image classification, particularly for DFU severity prediction.
